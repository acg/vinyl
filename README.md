# vinyl - a record processing suite #

What if you could do awk-style record processing in a general purpose programming language like python?

This is a preliminary release of a "lite" version of vinyl. The lite version includes support for mapping, aggregating and partitioning of text records. The full version supports other operations like indexing and fast random lookups via indices, and other formats like json and protocol buffers.
